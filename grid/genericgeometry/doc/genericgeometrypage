\section gg_refelements Generic Reference Elements

The generic geometries are based on generic reference elements. These are constructed
recursively by the following definitions:
- p denotes the 0-dimensional reference element consisting of a single point.
- \f$E^\vert := E \times [0,1]\f$ denotes a prism over some reference element \f$E\f$.
- \f$E^\circ := \lbrace ((1-y)x,y) \mid x \in E, y \in [0,1] \rbrace\f$ denotes
  the pyramid over some reference element \f$E\f$.
.
We will denote the dimension of a reference element \f$R\f$ by \f$\mathrm{dim}( R )\f$.

Note that all of these reference elements are convex polytopes and we can therefore
talk about their vertices. For a reference element \f$R\f$, denote by \f$n_r\f$ the
number of vertices of \f$R\f$ and denote the vertices by
\f$v^R_0, \ldots v^R_{n_r-1}\f$. We number the vertices of \f$R\f$ in the following
way:
- \f$R = p\f$: \f$n_R = 1\f$ and \f$v_0 = 0\f$,
- \f$R = E^\vert\f$: \f$n_R = 2 * n_E\f$ and
  \f$v^R_i = (v^E_{i \% n_E}, {i \over n_E})\f$,
- \f$R = E^\circ\f$: \f$n_R = n_E + 1\f$, \f$v^R_i = v^E_i\f$ for \f$i < n_E\f$
  and \f$v^R_{n_R-1} = (0,1)\f$ with \f$0 \in E\f$.
.

\section gg_numbering Numbering of Subentities

Having numbered the vertices, we can number subentities of arbitrary codimension.
Let R be a reference element. Since codimension \f$\mathrm{dim}( R )\f$ is already
numbered and numbering codimension 0 is trivial, now consider a codimension
\f$0 < c < \mathrm{dim}( R )\f$. Again using recursion, we define subentity number i
of codimension c by the following defition:
- \f$R = p\f$: cannot occur as \f$\mathrm{dim}( R ) = 0\f$,
.
